See LICENSE for license details.

A Unix system with Perl 5.12+ is required.  The following Perl modules are also
required. If you do not have them, install them via CPAN or your distribution's
package manager if available:

XML::LibXML
XML::LibXML::Reader
Getopt::Long
Date::Parse

Before using:
Download the latest Rift Discoveries file from 
ftp://ftp.trionworlds.com/rift/data/ and unzip it into the current directory.
You should end up with six large .xml files.

Usage: ./first.pl [-n "Character Name"] [-g "Guild Name"] [-s "Shard Name"]
Options may be given in any combination, including none.

Example:

    $ ./first.pl -n "Flashwit" -g "Honey Badgers"

Parsing and display will be slow as there is over 500MB of data to look
through!

Data is straight from Trion, so any weird results are their fault.
